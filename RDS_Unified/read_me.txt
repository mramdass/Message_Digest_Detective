Hash values of the files in the NSRL RDS are available on the website
to provide traceability, as the RDS may be freely copied to any media.
The RDS is digitally signed to allow NIST to be able to verify that no
changes have been made to its contents. As long as no modifications to
the contents have been made, a notice that NIST is the originator of
the contents must accompany each copy made. If modifications are made,
references to NIST as the producer must be removed.
