Dec 1, 2013 RDS 2.43

The full RDS Release has become too large for distribution on four CDROMs. For users familiar with the process of using four CDROMs to load RDS data you will find a directory called RDS_Split on this DVD. This directory contains the four RDS zip files that were traditionally distributed on the four CDROMS.

For users interested in processing a unified RDS set, a directory called RDS_Unified can be found on this DVD. This directory contains the RDS files as traditionally presented on the RDS DVD ISO.

The NSRL will be shifting to a single DVD physical release containing only one of these methods (Split, Unified). The NSRL welcomes input from its users. If you have a preference for one of these formats please contact us:
